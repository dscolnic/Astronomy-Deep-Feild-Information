# Astronomy-Deep-Feild-Information

This is a repository of information and scripts on existing and planned deep field observations for the 2020s.  The goal of this repository is to collect information on current and planned surveys to faciliate synergies between surveys.

The Survey_Description directory contains information for various surveys in a default format outlined in the Scolnic et al. decadal white paper. 

The Scripts directory contains useful scripts to plot and compair surveys.
